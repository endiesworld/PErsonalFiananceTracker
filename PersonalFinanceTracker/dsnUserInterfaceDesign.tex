\section{User Persona}
Define the persona of your users. You may have more than one user person for capturing different types
of user roles for your system.

\section{User Interface Design}
Please provide preliminary paper prototype of your user interface. This should capture the key
use cases/ user stories you defined in your project specification. Note that you do not need to
cover every corner case. Make sure that your UI design covers the major use cases/stories, and
the goals, tasks, and scenarios.
