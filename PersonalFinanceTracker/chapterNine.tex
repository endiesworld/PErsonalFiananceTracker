\section{Project Mission Statement}
Empowering individuals to take control of their financial future by harnessing AI-driven analytics for intelligent budgeting, planning, and wealth creation.

\section{Key Stakeholders}
\subsection{Customers}
We have divided the customers into different user classes based on their intended frequency of using the application. We expect the Favored User Class to be those who use the application the most, and therefore a majority of the features will be catered for these groups. Disfavored users still interact directly with the system, however the scope of the project limits developing features that would be comprehensive enough for them. 

\subsubsection{Favored User Classes}
Since this application is a "Personal" finance tracker, the needs of individuals are prioritized, and we considered them as part of the favored user class as they derive direct value from the system. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Working Individuals: This user group typically has to deal with rec curing bills pertaining to the cost of living (e.g., Rent, utilities, groceries, etc.), saving goals and unexpected expenses. They are favored since it is the largest target market which diverse financial needs which the application addresses. Features such as insights and recommendations, tax filing, and bank account integration can significantly assist these individuals with their financial management in the short and long term. 
    
    \item Students: Students often have a more limited income, if any, compared to working individuals. Their main concern is managing day-to-day expenses while staying within their financial means. They would benefit significantly from features like budgeting tools and insights and recommendations to budget their finances more efficiently. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disfavored User Classes}
Disfavored user classes are those whose needs are not prioritized due to misalignment with the system’s goals, complexity, or high cost of implementation relative to benefit. While these user groups can derive some benefit from this application, it is not to the extent of the favored user classes. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Small Business Owners: Small business owners often require tools for managing both personal and business finances. They may expect features like payroll management, invoicing, and business expense reporting. Their needs extend beyond personal finance tracking and may overlap with enterprise financial tools (e.g., QuickBooks). Supporting business-specific features would increase system complexity and development cost.
    
    \item Retail Investors: Retail investors often look for advanced financial tools to manage stocks, bonds, or other investments. They may expect integration with trading platforms or investment dashboards. Their needs are outside the scope of basic personal finance management and would require complex integrations with investment tools. Supporting this class would divert resources from core features like budgeting and spending insights.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Oversight Stakeholders}
Oversight stakeholders ensure the system adheres to laws, regulations, and standards. They shape security, privacy, and regulatory compliance requirements.
\subsubsection{Regulatory Agencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tax Authorities: This ensures compliance with tax laws, forms, and filing processes. They influence the requirements by making sure that the system supports automated tax calculations that align with the latest tax laws and is compatible with tax submission protocols (e.g., e-filing formats).
    
    \item Data Protection Agencies: This category of stakeholders includes agencies such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA (if health-related financial data is handled) which enforce data privacy laws to protect users' personal and financial information. Thes stakeholders will largeley impact system and security requirements like end-to-end encryption for sensitive user data and data management options (e.g., opt-in/opt-out for data sharing, user data deletion on request).
    
    \item Consumer Protection Agencies: These stakeholders are responsible for safeguarding user rights and ensure transparency in the app’s financial recommendations. They ensure the app provides reliable and unbiased financial advice without promoting harmful spending habits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supporting Stakeholders}
Supporting stakeholders provide resources, infrastructure, or services. They influence system integration and technical requirements to ensure the system functions as intended.

\subsubsection{API Providers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bank API Providers: Influence secure bank transaction integration and data retrieval performance. This is key for the Bank Account integration feature, and these stakeholders will have an impact on many of the quality requirements and technical specifications related to this feature.

    \item OCR API Providers: These providers drive requirements for accurate, automated receipt scanning (e.g., Google Vision, Amazon Textract). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Project Team}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development Team: This group is responsible for implementing functional requirements and ensuring technical feasibility. They enable the app's core features, such as budgeting tools, insights generation, and tax filing capabilities. 
    
    \item System Administrators: This group manages the infrastructure, scalability, and up-time of the app and supports requirements related to system performance, monitoring, and security.

    \item Support Team: Provide ongoing assistance to users and ensure smooth operations post-launch. Influence requirements for logging, troubleshooting tools, and in-app user support features.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential Conflicts among Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Core Stakeholders vs. Supporting Stakeholders}
\textbf{Conflict:} Working Individuals and Students (Core Stakeholders) demand real-time data retrieval for features such as bank integration, insights, and receipt scanning. However, API Providers (Supporting Stakeholders), particularly Bank API Providers, may impose \textit{rate limits} on transaction data retrieval, which could affect system performance.

\textbf{Impact:} Delays in syncing data may frustrate users who expect instantaneous updates.

\textbf{Proposed Resolution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement data caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of API calls.
    \item Negotiate premium access with API providers to increase rate limits.
    \item Clearly communicate data sync schedules to manage user expectations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Core Stakeholders vs. Regulatory Agencies}
\textbf{Conflict:} Data Protection Agencies (Regulatory Agencies) enforce strict privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), which require explicit user consent for data collection and sharing. Core Stakeholders expect seamless, automated features (e.g., receipt scanning and bank integration) with minimal manual intervention.

\textbf{Impact:} Frequent consent pop-ups or manual approvals can disrupt user experience and cause frustration.

\textbf{Proposed Resolution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement user-friendly consent management tools (e.g., toggles in settings).
    \item Provide clear explanations of data usage and its benefits to users.
    \item Use privacy-focused automation, such as anonymized data processing where possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Favored User Classes vs. Disfavored User Classes}
\textbf{Conflict:} Small Business Owners and Retail Investors (Disfavored User Classes) may demand advanced features like payroll management, investment tracking, or trading platform integration. The project team prioritizes features for Working Individuals and Students, which align more closely with the app’s core purpose.

\textbf{Impact:} Disfavored users may feel underserved, limiting adoption or leading to negative reviews.

\textbf{Proposed Resolution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly communicate the app’s focus on personal finance tracking.
    \item Offer third-party integrations to export data to tools like QuickBooks or trading platforms.
    \item Reserve advanced features for future development phases based on user demand.
\end{itemize}
